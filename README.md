# React Native plugin for SpeedChecker SDK

SpeedChecker plugin allows developers to integrate speed test features into their own React Native apps. You can also try our native apps on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.broadbandspeedchecker\&hl=en\_US) and [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id658790195), they are powered by the latest Speedchecker SDK versions. More information about [SpeedChecker SDKs](https://www.speedchecker.com/speed-test-tools/mobile-apps-and-sdks.html)

## Features

* latency, download and upload speed of the user connection
* robust measuring of cellular, wireless and even local network
* testing details like the current speed and progress
* additional information like network type and location (see KPI list below in FAQ)
* included high-capacity servers provided and maintained by [SpeedChecker](https://www.speedchecker.com) or custom servers
* detailed statistics and reports by SpeedChecker

## Platform Support

## Getting started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### 1. Create a React Native project
```
npx react-native init [project folder]
```

### 2. Go to project directory
```
cd [project folder]
```

### 3. Install the plugin from npm repository
````
npm i @speedchecker/react-native-plugin -- save
````

### 4. Link the plugin to your React Native project
````
npm link @speedchecker/react-native-plugin
````

### 5. Start the Metro Server

You will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### 6. Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## How to use

#### 1. Import SpeedCheckerPlugin in your App.tsx file.
````
import SpeedCheckerPlugin from '@speedchecker/react-native-plugin';
````

#### 2. Listen events from SpeedCheckerPlugin and all variables you need to store speed test results
````
const [status, setStatus] = useState('');
  const [ping, setPing] = useState('');
  const [currentSpeed, setCurrentSpeed] = useState('');
  const [download, setDownload] = useState('');
  const [upload, setUpload] = useState('');
  const [server, setServer] = useState('');
  const [connectionType, setConnectionType] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      SpeedCheckerPlugin.removeTestStartedListener();
    };
  }, []);
````

### 3. To start speed test by event (e.g. button click), you need to import the plugin and add "startTest" method to your App.tsx file:
````
const startTest = () => {
    SpeedCheckerPlugin.addTestStartedListener((event: {
      status: React.SetStateAction<string>;
      ping: React.SetStateAction<string>;
      currentSpeed: React.SetStateAction<string>;
      downloadSpeed: React.SetStateAction<string>;
      uploadSpeed: React.SetStateAction<string>;
      server: React.SetStateAction<string>;
      connectionType: React.SetStateAction<string>;
     }) => {
      setStatus(event.status || '');
      setPing(event.ping);
      setCurrentSpeed(event.currentSpeed);
      setDownload(event.downloadSpeed);
      setUpload(event.uploadSpeed);
      setServer(event.server);
      setConnectionType(event.connectionType);
    });
    SpeedCheckerPlugin.startTest();
  };
````

### 4. If you are paid user, you should set license key _before_ you start test. Please contact us and we will provide you with licenseKey for your app:

#### For Android licenseKey should be setup in Application onCreate method in native flutter project code.
````
class MainApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        SpeedcheckerSDK.setLicenseKey(this, "Insert your key here")
    }
}
````

#### For iOS
````
SpeedCheckerPlugin.setIosLicenseKey('Your license key')
````

If no license is set, test will be conducted in free mode and, as a result, request a location permission.

### 4. To stop speed test, add "stopTest" method to your App.tsx file:
````
 const stopTest = () => {
    SpeedCheckerPlugin.stopTest();
    setStatus('Speed Test stopped');
    SpeedCheckerPlugin.removeTestStartedListener();
  };
````

### 4. Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App!


## Uninstalling
To uninstall the plugin, run the following commands
```
npm unlink @speedchecker/react-native-plugin
npm uninstall @speedchecker/react-native-plugin --save
```

## FAQ

### **Is the SDK free to use?**

Yes! But the SDK collects data on network performance from your app and shares it with SpeedChecker and our clients. The free SDK version requires and
enabled location. Those restrictions are not in the Basic and Advanced versions

### **Do you have also native SDKs?**

Yes, we have both [Android](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-ios)
SDKs.

### **Do you provide other types of tests?**

Yes! YouTube video streaming, Voice over IP and other tests are supported by our native SDK libraries. Check out our [Android](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-android/wiki/API-documentation) and [iOS](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-ios/wiki/API-documentation) API documentation

### **Do you provide free support?**

No, we provide support only on Basic and Advanced plans

### **What are all the metrics or KPIs that you can get using our native SDKs?**

The free version of our plugin allows getting basic metrics which are described in
this [API documentation](https://github.com/speedchecker/react_plugin/wiki/API-documentation)

[Full list of our KPIs for Basic and Advanced versions](https://docs.speedchecker.com/measurement-methodology-links/u21ongNGAYLb6eo7cqjY/kpis-and-measurements/list-of-kpis)

### **Do you host all infrastructure for the test?**

Yes, you do not need to run any servers. We provide and maintain a network of high-quality servers and CDNs to ensure the testing is accurate. If you
wish to configure your own server, this is possible on Basic and Advanced plans.

### **How do you measure the speed?**

See our [measurement methodology](https://docs.speedchecker.com/measurement-methodology-links/u21ongNGAYLb6eo7cqjY/kpis-and-measurements/data-collection-methodologies)
